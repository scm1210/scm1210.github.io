## Why This Matters

::: incremental
-   **Scrambled eggs** seem *simple*, but most people do them wrong
-   The difference between rubbery, dry eggs and creamy, luxurious eggs is **technique**
-   This demo (if we had a kitchen) will teach: **preparation, timing, and temperature control**
-   Skills transfer to teaching: **breaking down complex tasks into manageable steps**
:::

::: notes
Opening hook: "How many of you have made scrambled eggs that turned out rubbery or dry? Almost everyone, right? Today I'm going to show you why that happens and how to fix it."

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this demo, you will be able to:

1.  **Identify** the key principles of perfect scrambled eggs
2.  **Apply** proper heat control and timing techniques
3.  **Evaluate** when eggs are perfectly done (before they look done!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## The Three Principles

### 1. Low & Slow

Gentle heat = creamy texture

### 2. Constant Motion

Keep stirring = even cooking

### 3. Pull Early

Remove before "done" = perfect eggs

## Ingredients & Tools

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
**What You Need:**

-   2-3 large eggs (jumbo preferred)
-   1 tablespoon [unsalted]{.underline} butter
-   Cheese (optional)
-   Salt and pepper
-   Dried herbs (optional)
-   Non-stick pan (stainless steel works best)
-   Rubber spatula

**Note:**

::: callout-tip
## *"Why butter instead of oil?"*
  
**Answer:** Butter's lower smoke point allows for gentler cooking

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 1: Preparation

::: incremental
1.  **Crack eggs** into a bowl
2.  **Whisk vigorously** for \~30 seconds until uniform and slightly frothy
3.  There should be **no visible streaks of white** in your eggs
:::

::: fragment
**Why this matters:** Incorporating air creates fluffiness and volume
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
💡 **Common Mistake:** Not whisking enough—lumps of white lead to uneven cooking
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 2: Heat Control (Critical!)

:::::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
**The Process:**

1.  Set burner to **medium-low** (3-4 out of 10)
2.  Melt butter until foaming stops
3.  Add eggs—should **gently** sizzle, not violently

**Temperature Check:** Hold your hand 4 inches above pan for 3 seconds

::: callout-warning
## Most Common Error

**Too much heat** = rubbery eggs

*"If it's cooking fast, it's cooking wrong"*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 3: The Cooking Technique

**Continuous Gentle Stirring**

::: incremental
-   Use silicone spatula to **push eggs from edge to center**
-   **Slow, deliberate movements**—not frantic scrambling
-   Create large, soft curds
-   **Timing:** This should take \~3-4 minutes total depending on your stove
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Step 4: Cooked!

### When am I done?

**When eggs look 80% done**

::: incremental
-   Still look **slightly wet and glossy**
-   **Remove from heat** immediately
-   They'll continue cooking (carryover heat)
-   **Serve immediately** on a warm plate
-   Add cheese and herbs if desired
:::

::: {.fragment .fade-in}
⚠️ **If they look fully cooked in the pan, they're overcooked on the plate!**

## Visual Guide: Done vs. Overdone

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
### ✅ Perfect

-   Soft, large curds
-   Slightly glossy
-   Creamy texture
-   Holds shape but jiggles
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
### ❌ Overcooked

-   Small, tight curds
-   Dry, matte appearance
-   Rubbery texture
-   Weeps liquid

## Troubleshooting Guide

| Problem         | Cause         | Solution                     |
|-----------------|---------------|------------------------------|
| Rubbery texture | Heat too high | Lower temperature, stir more |
| Watery eggs     | Undercooked   | Return to heat briefly       |
| Dry, crumbly    | Overcooked    | Remove earlier next time     |
| Uneven curds    | Poor whisking | Whisk eggs thoroughly before |
