# Background

::::::: inline-fragment
::: fragment
-   The U.S. is experiencing a mental health crisis (anxiety & depression).
:::

::: fragment
-   Access to care is unequal, especially for racial and ethnic minority groups.
:::

::: fragment
-   Language-based assessments promise scalable screening but recent evidence shows reduced performance for minority groups — risking widened disparities (see [Rai et al., 2024](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2319837121)).

# Research Aims

::::: inline-fragment
::: fragment
-   **Aim 1:** Test the sensitivity of language-based mental health assessments across a diverse set of racial and ethnic groups (i.e., White, Black, Latino, and Asian) in predicting current and future anxiety and depression symptoms.
:::

::: fragment
-   **Aim 2:** Explore the linguistic markers of anxiety and depression in racial and ethnic minorities.
:::
:::::

# Design

:::::: inline-fragment
::: fragment
**Description** - Two-session online longitudinal study. - Baseline: open-text responses about mood, motivation, sleep (≈25 min) + GAD-7 + PHQ-8. - Follow-up (3 weeks later): repeat assessments (≈10 min) and collect information on posts from social media.
:::

::: fragment
-   N = 1,600 (ages 18–40), balanced by race/ethnicity (White, Black, Latino, Asian).
:::

::: fragment
<!-- -->

-   **Recruitment platform:** Online panel (e.g., Prolific/CloudResearch) with demographic quotas.
-   Pilot: *N = 240 to validate prompts, retention, and preprocessing pipelines.*

# Aim 1 — Sensitivity Across Groups

::::: inline-fragment
::: fragment
**Goal:** Test prediction of current and future anxiety/depression across four racial/ethnic groups

**Hypothesis:** Reduced sensitivity for Black, Latino, and Asian participants vs. White participants.
:::

::: fragment
**Primary Analyses:**

-   Moderation: `lm(symptoms ~ race * ling_feat, data = data)`\
-   Linguistic features include (see [Eichstaedt et al., 2021](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2021-99502-001), [Kern et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27505683/) for more info):
    -   Sentiment, pronouns, emotion words (LIWC)\
    -   LLM-based inferences (e.g., GPT-4, LLaMA)\
    -   Contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa)
:::
:::::

# Aim 2 — Markers in Minority Groups

::::: inline-fragment
::: fragment
**Goal:** Exploratory/descriptive identification of linguistic markers of mental illness in minority groups.

-   Sentiment, pronouns, emotion words (LIWC)\
-   LLM-derived inferences (e.g., embeddings, LLM-based ratings, etc.)
:::

::: fragment
**Analyses:**\
- Descriptive statistics of linguistic features by racial/ethnic group\
- Identify features associated with higher/lower symptom levels for each group - Exploratory correlations and regressions for hypothesis generation

# Questions we have for you

::: scrollable
-   We are worried about the racial groups being treated as monoliths and thus want to capture (i) finer-grained racial/ethnic/cultural identities and (ii) relevant cultural dimensions that might relate to our research questions. This project can inform how culture shapes the linguistic markers of psychopathology, a question we’d love your help to address! Any thoughts welcome, but in particular:
    -   Any advice for best ways to assess racial/ethnic/cultural identities at a fine grained level than standard approach?
    -   Any other demographic factors should we consider?
    -   We would like to consider SES/class in particular:
        -   Any advice on measures?
        -   Should we worry about statistical power / diversity of online sample? How to handle multi-racial identities in modeling?
        -   What theories should we read to inform overall research question? What scales should we include to capture relevant cultural dimensions?
