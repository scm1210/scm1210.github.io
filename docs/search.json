This comes from R’s ability to use different packages. You can load packages into your current work environment by using the library(PACKAGE) function. It is important to note that in order to library a package you must first have it installed. To install a package you can use the install.packages(\"PACKAGE\") command. You can learn more about the different types of packages hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) here! One other important thing is that some packages often have similar commands (e.g., plyr and hmisc both use summarize) that are masked meaning that you will call a function and may not get the function you expect. To get around this you can use PACKAGE::FUNCTION to call package-specific function.\nFor this part of the script, and here forward, we use pacman to load in all of our packages rather than using the iterative if (!require(\"PACKAGE\")) install.packages(\"PACKAGE\") set-up. There’s still some merit to using that if loading in packages in a certain order creates issues (e.g.,tidyverse and brms in a certain fashion; I’ve had issues with this in the past -_-)."

For example, if I am working with two different corpora (e.g., Atlantic and NYT Best-Sellers) I will probably call the Atlantic dataframe atlantic and the NYT Best-sellers NYT for simplicity and so I don’t accidentally write over my files.\nFor example, if your WD is already set and the data exists within said directory you can use: df &lt;- read_csv(MY_CSV.csv)\nIf the data is on something like Github you can use: df &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scm1210/Language_Lab_Repro/main/Atlantic_Cleaned_all_vars.csv') #read in the data.\nIf you are working in one directory and need to call something for another directory you can do something like: Atlantic_FK &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/working-with-lyle/Atlantic/Atlantic_flesch_kinkaid_scores.csv\")\nThere are also other packages/functions that allow you to read in files with different extensions such as haven::read_sav() to read in a file from SPSS or rjson:: fromJSON(file=\"data.json\")to read in a json file. If you want to learn more about how to read in different files you can take a peek at this site.\n\n# Load the data\ndata(\"genderweight\", package = \"datarium\")\ngenderweight &lt;- as.data.frame(genderweight)\n\n# Show a sample of the data by group"

Using geom_denisty we then tell it we want to color our plot dodgerblue (my favorite R palette :) ), as well as fill it with that color using color=\"dodgerblue4\", fill=\"dodgerblue3\". We then add our plot_aes object (usually doesn’t matter too much where we add this). Next we add a vertical line to our denisty plot using geom_vline, tell it that we want it to be at the mean value of the weight variable (which must be a continuous variable) and then style it color=\"dodgerblue3\", linetype=\"dashed\", size=1, telling R we want a blue, dashed line.\nLastly, we annotate the graph using annotate_figure.

You can do that by modifying the file path or go session (on the upper bar) –&gt; set working directory). Working directories are important in R because they tell the computer where to look to grab information and save things like results. This can vary by project, script, etc. so it’s important to consistently have the appropriate WD. If you are unsure what your current WD is, you can use the getwd command in the console (usually the lower left hand pane) to get your WD.\n\n\n\n\nif (!require(\"pacman\")) install.packages(\"pacman\") #run this if you don't have pacman \nlibrary(pacman)\npacman::p_load(tidyverse, ggpubr, rstatix, caret, broom, kableExtra, reactable, Hmisc, datarium, car, DT,install = T) \n#use pacman to load packages quickly \n\nOne of the great things about R is its ability to be super flexible. This comes from R’s ability to use different packages. You can load packages into your current work environment by using the library(PACKAGE) function. It is important to note that in order to library a package you must first have it installed. To install a package you can use the install.packages(\"PACKAGE\") command. You can learn more about the different types of packages hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) here! One other important thing is that some packages often have similar commands (e.g., plyr and hmisc both use summarize) that are masked meaning that you will call a function and may not get the function you expect.

You can learn more about the different types of packages hosted on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) here!

    "text": "Statistical Assumptions\nAssumption are also important. That is, data need to possess certain qualities for us to be able to use this type of test. For a t-test these are:\n\nThe DV data are continuous (not ordinal or nominal).\nThe sample data have been randomly sampled from a population.\nThere is homogeneity of variance (i.e., the variability of the data in each group is similar).\nThe distribution is approximately normal.\n\nClick through the tabs to see how to check each assumption.\n\nContinuous\nWe can check this by looking at the structure of our data using the class function (for one variable) or str function (for all the variables in our dataset). We can see that weight is numeric and therefore continuous! Therefore, we can move forward with our analyses.\n\nclass(genderweight$weight)\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\nstr(genderweight)\n\n'data.frame':   40 obs. of  3 variables:\n $ id    : Factor w/ 40 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\",..: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ...\n $ group : Factor w/ 2 levels \"F\",\"M\": 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 ...\n $ weight: num  61.6 64.6 66.2 59.3 64.9 ...\n\n\n\n\nRandomly Sampled\nThis is something you do when you design the study–we can’t do anything in R to check this.\n\n\nHomogeneity of Variance\nWe need to make sure the variability of the data in each group is similar. We can use something called Levene’s Test for equality of error variances to do this. If we violate this assumption (p &lt;. 05 in our test) we will have to use a Welch’s T-test. We violate this assumption so if we were actually doing a meaningful project we would need to use a different statistical test. For the sake of brevity we’ll pretend we are ok for now.\n\nleveneTest(genderweight$weight ~ genderweight$group)\n\nLevene's Test for Homogeneity of Variance (center = median)\n      Df F value Pr(&gt;F)  \ngroup  1    6.12  0.018 *\n      38                 \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\n\n\n\nThe distribution is approximately normal.\nTo check the distribution of the data we can use density plots in the ggplot within tidyverse to visualize this. It’s also important to get some statistics behind this, and to do that we can look at skewness and kurtosis via the mystats function that we wrote earlier. You can also use psych::describe to get similar information. For skewness and kurtosis, we want values of skewness fall between − 3 and + 3, and kurtosis is appropriate from a range of − 10 to + 10\n\n# Basic density\np &lt;- ggplot(genderweight, aes(x=weight)) + \n  geom_density(color=\"dodgerblue4\", fill=\"dodgerblue3\", alpha=0.2) + plot_aes +\n  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=mean(weight)),\n            color=\"dodgerblue3\", linetype=\"dashed\", size=1) \nannotate_figure(p,\n                top = text_grob(\"Density Plots for both genders\",  color = \"black\", face = \"bold\", size = 20),\n                bottom = text_grob(\"Verical line represents mean value.\"\n                                   , color = \"Black\",\n                                   hjust = 1.1, x = 1, face = \"italic\", size = 12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also have the densities by gender.

Examining the impact of the pandemic on business leadership is particularly important to understanding how this event affected their decision-making. The present study documents the psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on chief executive officers (CEOs). This was accomplished by analyzing CEOs’ language from quarterly earnings calls (N = 19,536) for a year before and after lockdown. CEOs had large shifts in language in the months immediately following the start of the pandemic lockdowns. Analytic thinking plummeted after the world went into lockdown, with CEOs’ language becoming less technical and more personal and intuitive. In parallel, CEOs’ language showed signs of increased cognitive load, as they were processing the effect of the pandemic on their business practices. Business leaders’ use of collective-focused language (we-usage) dropped substantially after the pandemic began, perhaps suggesting CEOs felt disconnected from their companies. Self-focused (I-usage) language increased, showing the increased preoccupation of business leaders. The size of the observed shifts in language during the pandemic also dwarfed responses to other events that occurred dating back to 2010, with the effect lasting around seven months."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on business leadership, specifically on chief executive officers (CEOs). To document the psychological impacts of the pandemic on corporate leadership, this study analyzed the language of CEOs during company quarterly earnings calls (N = 19,536) one year before and after the onset of the pandemic. Following the start of lockdowns, CEOs exhibited significant language shifts. Analytic thinking declined, and their language became less technical and more personal and intuitive. CEOs also showed signs of increased cognitive load as they grappled with the pandemic’s impact on their business practices. The study observed a substantial decrease in collective-focused language (we-usage) among CEOs, indicative of disconnection from their companies. Concurrently, there was an increase in self-focused (I-usage) language, suggesting heightened preoccupation among business leaders. The observed language changes reflect the unique effect of the pandemic on CEOs, which had some notable differences compared to the general population. This study sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced business leaders’ psychological states and decision-making strategies—processes that have a substantial impact on a company’s performance. The findings underscore the importance of language data in understanding large-scale societal events.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., & Seraj, S. (2023).

    "text": "Abstract\nMental health challenges add immensely to the global burden of disease, yet traditional approaches to psychological assessment and care remain resource-intensive and often inaccessible. There is widespread interest in testing whether advances in artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), could address these constraints. This review focuses on LLMs, given the field’s explosive interest in testing whether their ability to generate context-sensitive language representations can aid large-scale assessment and intervention. We synthesize recent applications of LLMs, including language-based assessment of psychopathology, digital phenotyping, electronic health record analysis, and early integrations into psychotherapy. However, we highlight deep challenges of AI that loom large in the highly sensitive space of mental health treatment, including clear risks of bias, hallucinations, inappropriate (or even dangerous) therapeutic recommendations, and limited regulatory oversight. We conclude with future directions that are critical for the safe and equitable use of LLMs in mental health.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., & Nook, E. C. (2025).

    "text": "Abstract\nDecades of research hold that empathy is a multifaceted construct. A related challenge in empathy research is to describe how each subcomponent of empathy uniquely contributes to social outcomes. Here, we examined distinct mechanisms through which different components of empathy—Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Personal Distress—may relate to prosociality. Participants (N = 77) watched a prerecorded video of a person sharing an emotional real-life story and provided verbal support in response. The listeners then reported how positive and negative they felt while listening to the story. We found that individuals with greater tendencies to experience Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking felt more positive (e.g., connected, compassionate), whereas those with higher Personal Distress felt more negative (e.g., nervous, anxious) in response to another’s suffering. We also observed indirect relationships between Empathic Concern / Perspective Taking and the tendency to help others through positive affective responses to the other’s suffering. These findings build upon the growing literature that distinguishes different components of empathy and their mechanisms that relate to divergent behavioral consequences. Results also highlight the role of positive affect that may motivate prosociality in the face of others’ suffering.\nCitation: Kang, Y., Mesquiti, S., Baik, E. S., & Falk, E. B. (2025).

    "text": "This piece was published as an Op-ed in the San Antonio Express News\nScientific progress in the United States faces a series of threats. These disruptions have slashed federal research funding; upended the scientific process; dismantled diversity, equity and inclusion — DEI — initiatives; and endangered the careers of future and current scientists.\nIn particular, the federal government has frozen billions in funding for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation — both of which provide substantial medical and economic benefits to San Antonio and Texas.\nLast year, the NIH awarded nearly $2 billion in funding to Texan institutes, which supported more than 30,000 Texan jobs and generated more than $6 billion in economic activity.\nAs a scientist, I am deeply concerned about these funding cuts. I strongly believe in the direct and indirect opportunities that science provides to improve the lives of our community members.\nI am a Mexican American who was born and raised on San Antonio’s West Side, where programs like the Pre-Freshman Engineering Program, or PREP, gave me early exposure to careers in science and laid the foundation for my academic journey.\nToday, I am fortunate enough to be a psychology doctoral student at Princeton University, where I am conducting research showing how to identify individuals struggling with poor mental health by examining patterns in their language use.\nPrograms like PREP provided my first introduction to research, which was further developed in labs at Texas State University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Pennsylvania — all institutions supported by grants from the NIH and NSF.\nPrograms like PREP, often labeled as “DEI initiatives,” are not about exclusion. They are about giving everyone a shot at the American Dream. They ensure young people without built-in academic connections or financial resources have opportunities to pursue careers in science.\nWithout these programs, countless students — regardless of race, gender or political affiliation — will lose their chance to break into fields that shape our nation’s future.\nStripping funding from anything perceived as “DEI-adjacent” harms us all. It reduces available jobs in the state, freezes life-changing research and shuts the door on talented, hardworking students.\nTo make matters worse, recent government budget cuts have slashed funding for universities, including critical “indirect costs” that fund lab space, technical support, and salaries for scientists and staff.\nUniversities across the country, including the University of Texas at San Antonio, have already begun reducing graduate admissions. This disruption will shrink the pipeline of trained scientists, limit opportunities for young San Antonians, and jeopardize scientific progress in Texas and beyond.\nDue to decades of federally funded research, we have breakthroughs like revolutionary cancer treatments and lifesaving vaccines. Similar advancements have been made in our ability to detect mental health issues with language and provide more personalized support — progress that can save countless lives.\nThese advancements depend on continued support from institutions like the NIH and NSF, which drive our economy, research and the training of future scientists.\nPrograms that provide early exposure to science — especially for underrepresented students — ensure that the next generation is prepared to tackle issues like the mental health epidemic.\nCutting funding for research and training will stall progress and limit opportunities for young minds. Now more than ever, we must fight to protect science and its future to build a healthier, more resilient society for everyone.\n\nAbout the Author\nSteven Mesquiti was born and raised in San Antonio’s West Side. He completed his undergraduate studies at Southwestern University, has a master’s degree from Texas State University and is a doctoral student at Princeton University."

    "text": "This guide walks you through configuring your environment, authenticating access, and downloading the LLaMA 3 models from Hugging Face on the Adroit HPC system. It assumes you have basic familiarity with command line, Python, and HPC usage.\nThis process is infinitely easier if you have connected VSCode to the adroit cluster. Here is some info on that. IT also runs help sessions on this, which are very useful.\n\n\nBy default, Hugging Face stores downloaded models in your home directory (e.g., /home/username/.cache/huggingface), which may have limited storage on HPC systems. Redirect the cache to your scratch directory for ample space.\nYou can do that by using the checkquota command in the terminal to find out how much space you have in your scratch directory.\n\nSet the environment variable HF_HOME to your scratch directory:\n\nOn the Adroit login node, run this command to append the export statement to your .bashrc:\necho \"export HF_HOME=/scratch/network/$USER/.cache/huggingface/\" &gt;&gt; $HOME/.bashrc\n\nReload your shell configuration:\n\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nVerify the variable is set:\n\necho $HF_HOME\nThe excpected output should be:\n/scratch/network/&lt;YourNetID&gt;/.cache/huggingface/\n\n\n\nMeta requires users to accept a license and gain explicit access to the LLaMA 3 models on Hugging Face. So, this means you’ll need sign up for a Hugging Face account and request access to the LLaMA 3 models.\n\nGo to the LLaMA 3 model page on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B (or whatever model you want access to)\nLog in or create a Hugging Face account if you haven’t already.\nAccept the model license terms: Click the “Access repository” button and agree to the license to request access.\nWait for access to be granted. This should be relatively quick, but may take a few minutes to a few hours depending on demand.\n\n\n\n\nOnce access is granted, authenticate your HPC environment to allow downloading protected models.\n\nLog in to Hugging Face CLI:\n\nOn the Adroit login node, run the following command:\nhuggingface-cli login\n\nEnter your Hugging Face token:\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your Hugging Face access token. You can find this token in your Hugging Face account settings under “Access Tokens”. Copy and paste it into the terminal when prompted. Make sure not to share this with anyone since this is a personal access token that allows downloading models.\n\n\n\nNow that you have authenticated, you can download the LLaMA 3 model to your scratch directory.\n\nCreate a Python script download_llama3.py with this content:\n\nMake sure to replace meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B with the specific model you want\nto download if different. Also, make sure you have transformers installed in your Python environment.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B\"\ncache_path = \"/scratch/network/sm9518/.cache/huggingface\"  # replace with your actual NetID\n\n# Download model and tokenizer to cache\nAutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=cache_path)\nAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=cache_path)\n\nprint(f\"{model_id} Downloaded Successfully! to {cache_path}\")\n\nRun the script on the login node:\n\npython download_llama3.py\n\nThis will download all necessary model files into your scratch cache directory set by HF_HOME.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have downloaded the LLaMA 3 model to your scratch directory, you can run inference on an HPC compute node.\n\n\nSave the following code to /scratch/network/$USER/python_test/run_test_llama.py. This script loads the model and runs a short text generation example using the transformers pipeline API.\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\nimport os\n\nprint(f\"CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}\")\n\nif not torch.cuda.is_available():\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"CUDA is not available.

Otherwise, your job might be assigned to a GPU that is already fully used, causing CUDA out-of-memory errors.\n\nOn Adroit, you can use commands like these from the login node to check GPU availability:\n# Show GPU status and free GPUs per node \nshownodes -p gpu\nIf you don’t specify a node, Slurm will pick one for you, but it might not always be the best choice if GPUs on that node are busy."

    "text": "Abstract\nUsing social media data, the present study documents how three successive upheavals: the COVID pandemic, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests of 2020, and the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade interacted to impact the cognitive, emotional, and social styles of people in the US. Text analyses were conducted on 45,225,895 Reddit comments from 2,451,289 users and 889,402 news headlines from four news sources. Results revealed significant shifts in language related to self-focus (e.g., first-person singular pronouns), collective-focus (e.g., first-person plural pronouns), negative emotion (anxiety and anger words), and engagement (e.g., discussion of upheaval-related topics) after each event. Language analyses captured how social justice-related upheavals (BLM, Roe v. Wade) may have affected people in different ways emotionally than those that affected them personally (COVID). The onset of COVID was related to people becoming increasingly anxious and people turned inward to focus on their personal situations. However, BLM and the overturning of Roe v. Wade aroused anger and action, as people may have looked beyond themselves to address these issues. Analysis of upheaval-related discussions captured the public’s sustained interest in BLM and COVID, whereas interest in Roe v. Wade declined relatively quickly. Shifts in discussions also showed how events interacted as people focused on only one national event at a time, with interest in other events dampening when a new event occurred. The findings underscore the dynamic nature of culturally shared events that are apparent in everyday online language use.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., Seraj, S., Weyland, A. H., Ashokkumar, A., Boyd, R.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nWell-being is commonly defined in terms of comfort, happiness, functioning, and flourishing. Scholars distinguish between subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving life as pleasant) and psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving life as meaningful). While advances in natural language processing have enabled automated assessments of subjective well-being from language, their ability to capture psychological well-being remains underexplored. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined how well language-based models predict self-reported subjective and psychological well-being. Participants provided verbal or written responses about their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with standard questionnaire measures. We used contextual word embeddings from transformer-based models to predict well-being scores. Language-based predictions correlated moderately with questionnaire measures of both constructs (rs = .16–.63) and generalized across well-being domains (rs = .15–.50), though these associations were weaker than previously work (rs = .72–.85). Autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. Comparisons with GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 revealed that both models outperformed BERT in predicting satisfaction with life (r = .71 and .75) and modestly improved predictions of autonomy (rGPT‑4 = .49). Supervised dimension projections revealed that satisfaction with life responses clustered around positive emotion and social themes, whereas autonomy responses showed more individualized linguistic patterns. These findings suggest that language-based tools are well-suited for assessing hedonic well-being but face challenges with more abstract, eudaimonic constructs. Future research should refine modeling approaches to enhance the detection of complex psychological states while striking a balance between interpretability, accuracy, and usability.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., Cosme, D., Nook, E.

If you are working with multiple datasets, it’s advisable to call stuff by a intuitive name that allows you to know what the data actually is. For example, if I am working with two different corpora (e.g., Atlantic and NYT Best-Sellers) I will probably call the Atlantic dataframe atlantic and the NYT Best-sellers NYT for simplicity and so I don’t accidentally write over files.\nFor example, if your WD is already set and the data exists within said directory you can use: df &lt;- read_csv(MY_CSV.csv)\nIf the data is on something like Github you can use: df &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scm1210/Language_Lab_Repro/main/Atlantic_Cleaned_all_vars.csv') #read in the data.\nIf you are working in one directory and need to call something for another directory you can do something like: Atlantic_FK &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/working-with-lyle/Atlantic/Atlantic_flesch_kinkaid_scores.csv\")\nThere are also other packages/functions that allow you to read in files with different extensions such as haven::read_sav() to read in a file from SPSS or rjson:: fromJSON(file=\"data.json\")to read in a json file. If you want to learn more about how to reading in different files you can take a peek at this site.\nFor the first half, we are going to be using the mtcars dataset which is built into R and we are going to call it df.\n\n# Load the data\ndata(\"mtcars\")"

For example, if I am working with two different corpora (e.g., Atlantic and NYT Best-Sellers) I will probably call the Atlantic dataframe atlantic and the NYT Best-sellers NYT for simplicity and so I don’t accidentally write over files.\nFor example, if your WD is already set and the data exists within said directory you can use: df &lt;- read_csv(MY_CSV.csv)\nIf the data is on something like Github you can use: df &lt;- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/scm1210/Language_Lab_Repro/main/Atlantic_Cleaned_all_vars.csv') #read in the data.\nIf you are working in one directory and need to call something for another directory you can do something like: Atlantic_FK &lt;- read_csv(\"~/Desktop/working-with-lyle/Atlantic/Atlantic_flesch_kinkaid_scores.csv\")\nThere are also other packages/functions that allow you to read in files with different extensions such as haven::read_sav() to read in a file from SPSS or rjson:: fromJSON(file=\"data.json\")to read in a json file. If you want to learn more about how to reading in different files you can take a peek at this site.\nFor the first half, we are going to be using the mtcars dataset which is built into R and we are going to call it df.\n\n# Load the data\ndata(\"mtcars\")"

    "text": "Some other things\n\nSimple Correlation tests can only be calculated between continuous variables. However, there are other types of correlations tests that can be used to deal with different data types (that’s outside the scope of this tutorial).\nSpurious correlations exist (i.e., correlations != causation)! Just because something appears to be related, due to it’s correlation coefficient, doesn’t mean there’s actually a relationship there. For example, consumption of ice cream and boating accidents are often related. However, does eating more ice cream reallyyyy lead to people having boat accidents? Think about it. Also, if we are going to infer causation we have to manipulate variables experimentally. We often do not do that in studies where we use correlational analyses.\nYou should become familiar with how to interpret correlation coefficients (esp within your specific field). That is, what is a small, medium, and large correlation? At what point is a correlation coefficient too large (e.g., are you measuring the same construct)? Here’s an article that may help!"

For a t-test these are:\n\nThe data are continuous (not ordinal or nominal).\nData from both variables follow normal distributions.\nYour data have no outliers.\nYour data is from a random or representative sample.\nYou expect a linear relationship between the two variables.\n\nClick through the tabs to see how to check each assumption.\n\nContinuous\nWe can check this by looking at the structure of our data using the str function (for all the variables in our dataset). We can see what variables R is treating as continuous and move forward with our analyses!\n\nstr(mtcars)\n\n'data.frame':   32 obs. of  11 variables:\n $ mpg : num  21 21 22.8 21.4 18.7 18.1 14.3 24.4 22.8 19.2 ...\n $ cyl : num  6 6 4 6 8 6 8 4 4 6 ...\n $ disp: num  160 160 108 258 360 ...\n $ hp  : num  110 110 93 110 175 105 245 62 95 123 ...\n $ drat: num  3.9 3.9 3.85 3.08 3.15 2.76 3.21 3.69 3.92 3.92 ...\n $ wt  : num  2.62 2.88 2.32 3.21 3.44 ...\n $ qsec: num  16.5 17 18.6 19.4 17 ...\n $ vs  : num  0 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 ...\n $ am  : num  1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ...\n $ gear: num  4 4 4 3 3 3 3 4 4 4 ...\n $ carb: num  4 4 1 1 2 1 4 2 2 4 ...\n\n\n\n\nRandomly Sampled\nThis is something you do when you design the study–we can’t do anything in R to check this.\n\n\nNo outliers\nWe can use the QQ-plot to inspect for outliers, which is in the ggpubr package. To do this we are going to utilize R’s ability to write functions and for loops. First, we grab all of the names of the variables we want to get qq-plots for using vars &lt;- colnames(mtcars) and save them as a list in R. This will allow us to specify what variables we want to graph. Depending on what datset we are working with, that can be as few as 2 or as many as the entire dataset! Second, we write our qqplot_all function which allows us to write the same graph as many times as we want without having to write out graphing code every. single. time. This is especially useful when graphs don’t need unique customizations. Next, we write out for loop which allows us to use the qqplot_all function for each of the 11 graphs and save them as 11 unique objects named qq_var[i]. We then arrange all 11 using ggarrange so we can take a look. Lastly, we use Markdown’s customizability to specify how large (or small) we want out figure to be. Here we go with a 10 x 10 figure. We can see that the variable don’t have any observations &gt; abs(3) and therefore no outliers.\n\nvars &lt;- colnames(mtcars)\n\nqqplot_all &lt;- function(data) {\n  vars &lt;- names(data)\n  n_vars &lt;- length(vars)\n  \n  for(i in 1:n_vars) {\n    qqplot &lt;- ggqqplot(data[[i]], ylab = vars[i],color = \"dodgerblue\") + plot_aes\n    assign(paste0(\"qq_\", vars[i]), qqplot, envir = .GlobalEnv)\n  }\n}\n\nqqplot_all(mtcars) # create QQ plots for all variables\n\nggarrange(qq_am,qq_carb,qq_cyl,qq_disp,qq_drat,qq_gear,qq_hp,qq_mpg,qq_qsec,qq_vs,qq_wt, common.legend = T, legend = 'right')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNormal Distribution\nTo check the distribution of the data we can use density plots in the ggplot within tidyverse to visualize this. It’s also important to get some statistics behind this, and to do that we can look at skewness and kurtosis via the mystats function that we wrote earlier. You can also use psych::describe to get similar information. For skewness and kurtosis, we want values of skewness fall between − 3 and + 3, and kurtosis is appropriate from a range of − 10 to + 10.\nFor this example we are also going to visualize all of the variables in the dataset! To do this we are going to agian utilize R’s ability to write functions and for loops. First, we grab all of the names of the variables we want to get density plots for using vars &lt;- colnames(mtcars) and save them as a list in R. Second, we write our density function which allows us to write the same graph as many times as we want without having to write out graphing code every. single. time. Next, we write out for loop which allows us to use the density function for each of the 11 graphs and save them as 11 unique objects named d[i]. We then arrange all 11 using ggarrange so we can take a look. Lastly, we use Markdown’s customizability to specify how large (or small) we want out figure to be.\n\n#names &lt;- select(data,14:130) #get names of certain variables \n#names &lt;- colnames(df) #if you wanna graph ALL the variables\n\nvars &lt;- colnames(mtcars)\n\n#loop to create density plots \n\ndensity &lt;- function(data, x, y){ #create graphing function \nggplot(data = data) +\n  geom_density(aes_string(x = vars[i]),\n               adjust = 1.5, \n               alpha = 0.5, fill = \"dodgerblue\") + plot_aes\n}\n\nfor(i in 1:11) { #loop use graphing function 11 times\n  nam &lt;- paste(\"d\", i, sep = \"\")\n  assign(nam, density(mtcars,vars[i]))\n}\nggarrange(d1,d2,d3,d4,d5,d6,d7,d8,d9,d10,d11, common.legend = T, legend = 'right')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou expect a linear relationship between the two variables.\nTo check this assumption you can plot a scatter and plot between two variables and plot a line of best fit using ggplot.

Some of the points are above the blue curve and some are below it; overall, the residual errors (e) have approximately mean zero.\nThe sum of the squares of the residual errors are called the Residual Sum of Squares or RSS.\nThe average variation of points around the fitted regression line is called the Residual Standard Error (RSE; often just referred to as the standard error [SE]). This is one the metrics used to evaluate the overall quality of the fitted regression model. The lower the RSE, the better it is.\nSince the mean error term is zero, the outcome variable y can be approximately estimated as follow:\ny ~ b0 + b1*x\nMathematically, the beta coefficients (b0 and b1) are determined so that the RSS is as minimal as possible. This method of determining the beta coefficients is technically called least squares regression or ordinary least squares (OLS) regression.\nOnce, the beta coefficients are calculated, a t-test is performed to check whether or not these coefficients are significantly different from zero. A non-zero beta coefficients means that there is a significant relationship between the predictors (x) and the outcome variable (y)."

Its value ranges between -1 (perfect negative correlation: when x increases, y decreases) and +1 (perfect positive correlation: when x increases, y increases).\nA value closer to 0 suggests a weak relationship between the variables. A low correlation (-0.2 &lt; x &lt; 0.2) probably suggests that much of variation of the outcome variable (y) is not explained by the predictor (x). In such case, we should probably look for better predictor variables. Also want to note that the ‘size’ of correlations also depends on the field you’re working in and the nature of the data. For example, a correlation of (-0.2 &lt; x &lt; 0.2) for working with language data may be considered sizable if there are a ton of observations :). Additionally, if your correlation coefficient is too large, then you start to run into issues with multicollinearlity (or measuring the same thing), but more on that later!\nIn our example, the correlation coefficient is large enough, so we can continue by building a linear model of y as a function of x."

    "text": "Standard errors and confidence intervals\nThe standard error measures the variability/accuracy of the beta coefficients. It can be used to compute the confidence intervals of the coefficients. Frequentest approach confidence intervals should be interpreted as:\n\nConfidence Level: The first thing to understand is the confidence level associated with the interval. For example, if you have a 95% confidence interval, this means that if you were to repeat the sampling and estimation process many times, 95% of those intervals would contain the true population parameter.\nInterval Range: The interval itself is a range of values, usually expressed as “estimate ± margin of error.” For example, if the estimate is 10 and the margin of error is 2, the interval would be 8 to 12. This means that we are 95% confident that the true parameter value falls within this range.\nUncertainty: It’s important to understand that the interval provides a range of plausible values, but it does not tell us the exact value of the parameter. There is always some uncertainty associated with the estimate.\nSample Size: The width of the interval depends on the sample size and the variability of the data. A larger sample size generally leads to a narrower interval, while more variability leads to a wider interval.\nRelevance: Finally, it’s important to consider the context of the problem and whether the interval is relevant for making decisions. If the interval is too wide to provide useful information, it may be necessary to collect more data or use a different statistical method. Additionally, it’s important to consider any assumptions or limitations of the statistical model used to construct the interval.\n\nFor example, the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient b1 is defined as b1 +/- 2*SE(b1), where:\n\nthe lower limits of b1 = b1 - 2SE(b1) = 0.047 - 20.00269 = 0.042\nthe upper limits of b1 = b1 + 2SE(b1) = 0.047 + 20.00269 = 0.052\n\nThat is, there is approximately a 95% chance that the interval [0.042, 0.052] will contain the true value of b1. Similarly the 95% confidence interval for b0 can be computed as b0 +/- 2*SE(b0).\nTo get these information, simply type confint(model):\n\nconfint(model)\n\n              2.5 %  97.5 %\n(Intercept) 7.35566 9.52256\nyoutube     0.04223 0.05284"

When comparing two models, the model with the small RSE is a good indication that this model fits the best the data.\nDividing the RSE by the average value of the outcome variable will give you the prediction error rate, which should be as small as possible.\nIn our example, RSE = 3.91, meaning that the observed sales values deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3.9 units in average.\nWhether or not an RSE of 3.9 units is an acceptable prediction error is subjective and depends on the problem context.

    "text": "F-Statistic\nThe F-statistic gives the overall significance of the model. It assess whether at least one predictor variable has a non-zero coefficient.\nIn a simple linear regression, this test is not really interesting since it just duplicates the information in given by the t-test, available in the coefficient table. In fact, the F test is identical to the square of the t test: 312.1 = (17.67)^2. This is true in any model with 1 degree of freedom.\nThe F-statistic becomes more important once we start using multiple predictors as in multiple linear regression.\nA large F-statistic will corresponds to a statistically significant p-value (p &lt; 0.05). In our example, the F-statistic equal 312.14 producing a p-value of 1.46e-42, which is highly significant."

    "text": "Interpret\nIn our example, it can be seen that p-value of the F-statistic is &lt; 2.2e-16, which is highly significant. This means that, at least, one of the predictor variables is significantly related to the outcome variable.\nTo see which predictor variables are significant, you can examine the coefficients table, which shows the estimate of regression beta coefficients and the associated t-statistic p-values:\n\ntable_model(model)\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a given the predictor, the t-statistic evaluates whether or not there is significant association between the predictor and the outcome variable, that is whether the beta coefficient of the predictor is significantly different from zero.\nIt can be seen that, changing in youtube and facebook advertising budget are significantly associated to changes in sales while changes in newspaper budget is not significantly associated with sales.\nFor a given predictor variable, the coefficient (b) can be interpreted as the average effect on y of a one unit increase in predictor, holding all other predictors fixed.\nFor example, for a fixed amount of youtube and newspaper advertising budget, spending an additional 1 000 dollars on facebook advertising leads to an increase in sales by approximately 0.1885*1000 = 189 sale units, on average.\nThe youtube coefficient suggests that for every 1 000 dollars increase in youtube advertising budget, holding all other predictors constant, we can expect an increase of 0.045*1000 = 45 sales units, on average.\nWe found that newspaper is not significant in the multiple regression model. This means that, for a fixed amount of youtube and newspaper advertising budget, changes in the newspaper advertising budget will not significantly affect sales units.\nAs the newspaper variable is not significant, it is possible to remove it from the model:\n\nmodel  &lt;- lm(sales ~ youtube + facebook, data = marketing)\nsummary(model)\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = sales ~ youtube + facebook, data = marketing)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-10.557  -1.050   0.291   1.405   3.399 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

    "text": "1.1 Roles and Expectations\n\n1.1.1 Principal Investigator (PI)\nThe PI, Steven Mesquiti, is responsible for the overall direction of the lab and its research. The PI provides ideas and/or consultation on all the lab projects including theory development, empirical work, and grant proposals.\n\n\n1.1.2 Research Directors (RDs)\nResearch Directors are full-time post-PhD research staff who may have different roles depending on their career goals and interests. In general, RDs are here to:\n\nDo research\nSupport the major projects in the lab\nHelp write grants\nMentor and help train others in the lab\nHelp decide the greater direction that the lab goes in (both in terms of lab culture/organization and in terms of research topics/future projects)\n\n\n\n1.1.3 Post-docs\nPostdocs are full-time researchers here to learn new skills, mentor, and help train others in the lab. Postdocs share the mission of graduate students to develop their independent lines of research. This includes but is not limited to:\n\nLearning to write grants\nDesigning and implementing novel research\nAnalyzing new and existing data\nWriting manuscripts\nDeveloping mentorship and management skills required for becoming a PI ✨\n\n\n\n1.1.4 Research Coordinators and Lab Managers (RCLMs)\nRCLMs are full-time staff who have undergrad degrees (and sometimes master’s, too). All lab managers are research coordinators, but not all research coordinators are lab managers.\nResearch Coordinators (RCs) support the needs of ongoing research projects. They may be assigned to play a large role on one project or many smaller roles across multiple projects. This often includes:\n\nHelping with recruitment\nData collection\nIRB management\nProject documentation\n\nLab Managers (LMs) are the subset of RCs who are also responsible for providing administrative support to the lab and all of its members. This may include but is not limited to:\n\nHelping with meeting scheduling\nDocumenting lab processes (like this handbook)\nManaging lab resources and accounts\nGenerally knowing the ins and outs of how the lab functions.\n\n\n\n1.1.5 Graduate Students\nGraduate students can have many broad goals during their time in the lab, but nearly all of them involve:\n\nCompleting the requirements of their doctoral program\nLearning how to generate and communicate evidence-based knowledge and develop an independent program of research\nHelping mentor junior scholars\n\nPh.D. students might also work on external partnerships, build bridges with other labs, or engage in other activities that relate to their scholarship.\n\n\n1.1.6 Undergraduate RAs\nResearch assistants often take on a range of tasks from planning studies and conducting literature reviews to running participants and managing data. Each study has unique specific requirements but Undergraduate RAs are expected to follow the broad norms and expectations of the lab, while working with us."

    "title": "WORDLE Lab Manual",
    "section": "3.1 Core Values",
    "text": "3.1 Core Values\n\n3.1.1 Well-being\nHere, we value well-being both on the inside and outside, in ourselves, the lab, the communities we inhabit, and the world we live in. In our lab, we strive to work hard and to make time for ourselves and others. As part of this, we recognize that there is life outside of work, and that the experiences we have beyond our work can enrich what we do here.\nBeyond “self-care,” we also promote “other care”. This means building a community in which we support and care for one another. We aim to be generous to one another in domains where we excel and to lean on each other as we work on areas where we are still learning; and to be there for each other as people.\nWhat this looks like:\n\nCreating norms and values that promote your well-being and that of others in the lab\nEncouraging others to prioritize their own wellbeing\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“Hey Steven, I see that you’ve got a lot of things you’re working on. Are you stretching yourself a little too thin and is there anything I can take off your plate?”\n\n\n“Hey Steven, I am feeling a bit overwhelmed with my responsibilities for the week. Do you have bandwidth to help me out on ____? Or is it okay if I get this to you at a later date?”\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Joy\nWe use joy as one guide to direct our work. Additionally, our lab loves to celebrate its members’ accomplishments, no matter the size. Be sure to let your labmates know of any successes — such as sharing a plot you’re proud of, making a project milestone, learning a new skill, or facilitating a meaningful mentorship moment — so that we can celebrate your successes with you.\nSuccesses are self-defined and come in various shapes and sizes. We seek to recognize these wins as a means to acknowledge progress, and cultivate and sustain energy and motivation. We also celebrate failure as a learning opportunity. We also love hearing about the joys you are experiencing outside of work, whether that’s a really fun experience with others, a book that moved you, or a picture of your dog.\nWhen a project or task no longer brings you joy, communicate your needs to find ways to work for you (e.g., taking a pause or finding a work buddy to set intentions and check-in/co-work virtually or in-person). Remember, we are still people doing science.\nWhat this looks like:\n\nRealizing you really like working with someone or on something and ‘leaning into it’\nSharing mini-wins with the lab during planning, a project team meeting, or on slack\nTaking someone for coffee to celebrate a conference presentation\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“I received some strong comments in my R&R and I wanted to share with the lab!”\n\n\n“I really love working on this project with Jamie, is there any way I can work with her more?”\n\n\n“Congratulations to Mia! She gave a great talk in class the other day, and I thought others would be interested to hear about it!”\n\n\n“Nice work troubleshooting that code you were stuck on, that’s progress!”\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Respect\nIn the Lab, we have respect for others’ ideas, perspectives, needs, boundaries, health, time, and well-being. This is crucial for the development of ideas and the support of others. There is no such thing as a ‘stupid question’. If something isn’t immediately clear to you, odds are it isn’t to others as well, so please ask!\nWhen requesting things (e.g., rec letters) please be mindful of the turnaround time.\nWhat this looks like:\n\n‘Schedule’ send messages/emails for non-urgent items on weekends, holidays, etc.\nAsking questions that help to enhance an idea rather than tear someone down\nAsking questions about what a person needs or what boundaries (e.g., time constraints) they might have when collaborating\nWe can also decenter ourselves when asking questions. Example: “One may be curious about how point 2 has implications for clinical practice.”\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“Hey Ryan, could you please actually clarify point 2? I think it would really enhance your idea. Here are some specific ways to consider that may help clarify X,Y,Z”\n\n\n“Erik (this is a queued message), when you get a chance could you please send me X? No rush at all.”\n\n\n“Emily, I know you have a lot in your queue, when do you need me to send you my SAS submission so that you have enough time to review it before the deadline?”\n\n\n\n3.1.4 Community Building\nAcademia often promotes a lifestyle of hyper-competitiveness and work-life imbalance, which can lead to decreased well-being and increases in psychopathology. It also stifles creativity and can undermine the very insights we hope to nourish and produce as a research group.\n\nYou belong here. You are enough. You are valued.\n\nWe seek to cultivate an environment in which these statements are embodied.\nWhat this looks like:\n\nCreating systems and standards that promote inclusion, connection, and belonging\nDeveloping norms that foster and support collaboration\nBuilding a lab culture where people feel included and supported\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“Hey everyone, I’m going to eat lunch at Sally Frank Cafe! Anyone and everyone is welcome to join.”\n\n\n“Does anybody want to do a co-working session this week?”\n\n\n“The Talkspace working group is meeting today. Feel free to join!”\n\n\n“I’ve got an idea for a new project and would love to talk about potential opportunities for collaboration.”\n\n\n\n3.1.5 Psychological Safety\nWe do our best to be open-minded and welcome differing opinions. It’s okay to be wrong, change your mind, make mistakes; we are all human and this is necessary for learning and growing. Conflict and disagreement will naturally arise when working in groups and can be generative when dealt with in productive ways.\nWe are committed to working through conflict in ways that respect each other, give grace to each other, and minimize harm. Together, we can work to maintain a safe environment in which everyone feels like they belong, are valued, and can make the world a more inclusive place.\nWe can be mindful of peoples’ different communication styles (e.g., eye contact and seating).\nWhat this looks like:\n\nBeing courageous and presenting an idea that is not fully developed in front of the lab or asking for help\nSpeaking out when you disagree with something, and having a candid and respectful conversation about it either in the moment or at a later time\nIf you feel less comfortable directly expressing a critique, you can offer the question or feedback from a more distanced perspective\nSome people may need to close their eyes or not maintain eye contact to be able to process verbal information\nSitting during meetings may differ (side by side, across from one another, needing to move or stand)\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“Steven, actually I disagree with that point. I think we should really emphasize this instead.”\n\n\n“Steven, when you interrupted me, it made me feel like my perspective didn’t matter, and I’d appreciate it if you waited until I finished speaking in the future.”\n\n\n“Sarah, you’re right, I conducted the wrong analysis; let me go back and change it.”\n\n\n\n3.1.6 Communication\nYou won’t always be able to do everything you think you will—that’s okay, that’s normal. Do your best to communicate that to your labmates so they’re aware, and can get you unstuck if needed. Additionally, use lab, project, or team meetings to communicate to others what’s on your plate, what your priorities are, and where you might need support from them.\nWhat this looks like:\n\nLetting people know when you’re taking on too much\nNot being afraid to reach out to someone if you don’t know how to do something\nAs team members, we can also incorporate questions into our meetings that ask people what they need\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“Hey Dani, can I ask you a stats question?”\n\n\n“Actually Steven, I’m not sure I’ll be able to do that task in the time allotted since I have X going on. I could trade it out for Y task.”\n\n\n“You mentioned you were unsure how to proceed with the multilevel model. Tell me more about what you need to move forward.”\n\n\n\n3.1.7 Transparency\nWe are ultimately here to grow and learn. Lab members are encouraged to support and promote each other’s intellectual and career aspirations and to encourage each other to thrive in our personal lives. Our lab maintains a collection of career development resources in the Career Development section of the Lab Wiki.\nScholarship advances when researchers work with integrity to ensure their work is transparent and reproducible. For quantitative research, the Lab operates as a part of the open research community by:\n\nReporting our research choices in clear and transparent ways via pre-registration\nAcknowledging aspects of our work that are exploratory versus confirmatory\nEngaging in open science best practices\nInternal replication\n\nAdditionally, academia is full of unspoken norms (i.e. the “hidden curriculum”) that perpetuate systemic barriers against marginalized peoples. We try our best to address these disparities by communicating and documenting these norms, and sharing them with early career researchers both within and outside our lab.\n\n\n3.1.8 Process Orientation\nThe research process is as important as the final product. For this reason, we document our work and follow the available protocols or guidelines during each step of the research process, while continuously experimenting and improving upon them.\nWe encourage lab members to focus not only on the quality of the outcome, but on the processes that lead to it! If you tried something new that worked for your research, or that did not work, share your knowledge and add it to the research guides on the Lab Notion.\n\n\n3.1.9 Curiosity and Intellectual Development\nLab members are encouraged to openly ask questions and strive for intellectual growth. We try to be curious not only about the world around us but also about what’s right in front of us. Our lab uses various methods from Psychology, Computer Science, Natural Language Processing, and Information Theory to investigate a diverse set of questions. Even if the person down the hall has interests that diverge from our own, we cultivate curiosity about the phenomena they study, the methods they employ, and the insights about which they are passionate.\nWhat this looks like:\n\nListening actively\nAsking clarifying questions that may improve an idea, even if they are ‘hard’\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“I would love to hear more!”\n\n\n“What do you mean by that, Steven?”\n\n\n“What I hear you saying is… Am I right?”\n\n\n\n3.1.10 Equity\nOur lab is committed to continuously building a community and environment where members of all identities and backgrounds can thrive. We seek to promote greater equity in the academy and beyond, and to dismantle systems of oppression in society. We seek to support equity in how we do our work, and increase equity in society as a result of our work.\nIt’s our job to recognize the privileges and resources that we have access to that are unique and special and to critically use them in a responsible manner to contribute to a broader range for others to have access to.\nWhat this looks like:\n\nCreating standards that promote opportunities for others within and outside the lab\nMentoring students from backgrounds that are underrepresented in academia to increase their opportunities\nPeople have unique needs and goals that may require different forms of support, which require a network of support in and outside of the lab\n\nWhat this sounds like:\n\n“Hey, did you see this continuing ed opportunity?”\n\n\n“I really think we should take X REU student to increase their odds of being exposed to research at a R1 university.”\n\n\n\n3.1.11 Diversity & Inclusivity\nBeing a group with a rich and diverse set of identities, perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences is a strength. It enriches our lab culture and our research.\nAcademia has long failed to provide an equitable or inclusive environment, specifically for Black, Indigenous, and people of color (BIPOC), first generation college and low income (FGLI), and LGBTQIA+ communities, who face varying forms of racism, discrimination, and other structural barriers. Within social and biomedical sciences, participant samples are also skewed toward WEIRD (White, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic) samples, which limits the generalizability of our work.\nWe are committed to supporting members of underrepresented and marginalized groups in science and to being active allies to members of groups we are not a part of. We further aim to—when possible—focus on recruiting representative and inclusive participant samples in our research. All members of the Lab are expected to behave in a manner that promotes an inclusive environment for all."

The lab does its best to respect healthy work-life boundaries and uses unscheduled phone calls for emergencies. Timely response to email (and Slack) is expected (ideally within 24 business hours for intra-lab communications), and we do our best to be punctual for lab meetings and events.\n\n5.1.1 Email Best Practices\n\nIt can be helpful to bold important parts of the email, such as the question you are asking or the person to which a certain part is addressed to\nWhen writing times, writing out the full date and time with the time zone (e.g., Will Tuesday March 6, 11 AM EST work for you?) can help making scheduling easier and prevent miscommunication\nWhen setting up a time to meet with someone, suggesting a few times, and then ask them to suggest a time if those don’t work\n\nIf you are running late for a meeting or event, be sure to notify a fellow Lab member by email or slack. Similarly, if you cannot attend a meeting or event, please inform the planning committee or Lab members ahead of time.\n\n\n5.1.2 Ping Again!\nIf others (anyone, outside of Lab, too) takes longer than 48 hours to respond, follow up (“Hey Steven, just checking in on this! Thanks”). It’s helpful for them and for you and shouldn’t be perceived as being pushy!\n\n\n5.1.3 Responses\nYou do NOT have to respond to emails or slack messages during the weekend.

We acknowledge that the trajectory of a research project can be difficult to predict, so authorship discussions should happen early and should be revisited if anything changes.\n\n6.1.1 Criteria for Authorship\nTo qualify for authorship, individuals should make substantial contributions in at least two of the following areas:\n\nConception and design - Developing research questions, hypotheses, or study design\nData collection - Recruiting participants, programming experiments, running sessions\nData analysis - Conducting statistical analyses, creating visualizations, interpreting results\nWriting - Drafting or substantially revising the manuscript\nSecuring funding - Writing grants that support the research\n\n\n\n6.1.2 Authorship Order and Expectations\n\nFirst author: Primary contributor who typically led the project, conducted most analyses, and wrote the initial draft\nSecond/middle authors: Made substantial contributions but less extensive than the first author. Order is typically determined by relative contribution\nLast author: Typically the PI (Steven) who provided oversight, funding, and conceptual guidance\nCo-first authors: When two individuals contributed equally, this should be indicated with a footnote\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Special Considerations\n\nUndergraduate RAs: If an RA contributes substantially (e.g., leads data collection, performs analyses, writes methods), they should be considered for authorship\nLab managers/RCs: Contributing to routine lab operations alone does not warrant authorship, but substantial intellectual or analytical contributions do\nExternal collaborators: Early discussions about authorship expectations prevent misunderstandings\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Acknowledgments\nIndividuals who contributed but do not meet authorship criteria should be acknowledged. This includes:\n\nTechnical support (e.g., helping to analyze data on the cluster, prep data, etc.)\nFeedback on ideas or drafts\nFunding sources\nParticipants (collecting data)\nHelpful conversations\n\n\n\n6.1.5 Resolving Disputes\n\nProject leads should be mindful of who has contributed to the project and proactively discuss authorship\nIf disagreements arise, Steven will mediate\nDocumentation of contributions (in project logs, GitHub commits, etc.) can help clarify contributions\n\nWhen in doubt, lab members are encouraged to communicate openly with Steven or other Senior Lab Members."

It helps distinguish confirmatory from exploratory research and increases transparency.\n\n7.3.1 When to Preregister\n\nHigh Encouraged for confirmatory studies - Any study designed to test pre-specified hypotheses should be preregistered\nEncouraged for exploratory studies - Even exploratory work benefits from documenting initial plans\nNot required for secondary data analysis - When analyzing existing datasets, clearly label analyses as exploratory unless there was a pre-existing analysis plan\n\n\n\n7.3.2 What to Include\nA comprehensive preregistration should include:\n\nResearch questions and hypotheses\nStudy design and sampling plan\nVariables and measures\nData collection procedures\nPlanned data exclusions\nAnalysis plan (statistical tests, software, etc.)\nInference criteria (e.g., alpha levels, Bayes factors)\n\nFor more detailed information, please see the Lab Wiki.\n\n\n7.3.3 Where to Preregister\n\nOpen Science Framework (OSF) - Preferred platform; allows embargoed and public registrations\nAsPredicted.org - Simple, quick preregistrations\nClinicalTrials.gov - For clinical trials (when applicable)\n\n\n\n7.3.4 Deviations from Preregistration\nResearch plans often need to change. This is normal and acceptable, but it is importan to document all deviations in the manuscript, distinguish between confirmatory (pre-registered) and exploratory analyses clearly in the manuscript, explain why deviations were necessary, and be transparent about changes strengthens rather than weakens the work.\n\n\n7.3.5 Timeline\nWhen should you Preregister? Typically, preregistration should occur before data collection begins (for new studies) For multi-study papers, one can preregister each study separately/"

For online studies, consent must be documented electronically\n\n\n8.1.3 Data Privacy and Confidentiality\nParticipant data must be de-identified as soon as possible in the analysis processes (e.g., Prolific IDs). Personal identifiers (names, emails, etc.) should be stored separately from research data. Use participant IDs rather than names in all data files and documentation. Data containing identifiable information must be stored on secure, encrypted systems (e.g., the Lab Server). When sharing data publicly, ensure all identifying information has been removed\n\n\n8.1.4 Vulnerable Populations\nSpecial care must be taken when working with vulnerable populations (children, individuals with mental health conditions, etc.):\n\nAdditional protections and oversight may be required\nConsult with the IRB early in the planning process\nHave clear protocols for responding to distress or mandatory reporting situations\n\n\n\n8.1.5 Compensation\nThe Lab deems it important that participants are compensated fairly for their time.

With that in mind, it is important to discuss what harassment can look like and outline the available channels for reporting.\nThe following definitions of harassment are borrowed from the Social Affective Neuroscience Society (SANS) code of conduct:\n\n“Sexual harassment refers to unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature. Behavior and language that are welcome and acceptable to one person may be unwelcome and offensive to another. Consequently, individuals must use discretion to ensure that their words and actions communicate respect for others. This is especially important for those in positions of authority since individuals with lower rank or status may be reluctant to express their objections or discomfort regarding unwelcome behavior.”"

    "text": "15.1 What Constitutes a Conflict of Interest\nConflicts of interest in research can take many forms, and understanding what constitutes a conflict is the first step in managing them appropriately.\n\n15.1.1 Financial Conflicts\nFinancial conflicts of interest arise when you have monetary interests that could be affected by your research outcomes. These include holding equity or financial interest in a company whose products or services are related to your research, maintaining consulting relationships with companies in your research area, receiving speaking fees or honoraria from organizations that could benefit from your research findings, or earning royalties from products related to your research. Even when these financial relationships don’t actually influence your work, they can create the appearance of bias and must be disclosed and managed appropriately.\n\n\n15.1.2 Non-Financial Conflicts\nNot all conflicts of interest involve money. Non-financial conflicts can be equally important and sometimes more difficult to identify. These include personal relationships with study participants or collaborators that could bias research outcomes, strongly held beliefs or ideological commitments that could influence research design or interpretation, and situations where your professional advancement depends on achieving specific research outcomes. For example, if your dissertation, tenure case, or promotion relies heavily on finding significant results in a particular direction, this creates a non-financial conflict that should be acknowledged and managed.\n\n\n15.1.3 Examples of Potential Conflicts\nTo make these concepts more concrete, consider the following examples: owning stock in a company that produces mental health assessment tools while conducting research that evaluates similar tools creates a clear financial conflict. Having a close family member as a study participant could bias how you collect or interpret data from that individual. Consulting for a company while publishing research relevant to their products raises questions about whether your findings might be influenced by that relationship. Similarly, serving on the board of an organization that could benefit from your research conclusions—even if it’s a nonprofit or advocacy organization you believe in—represents a potential conflict that should be disclosed."

Conflicts must be disclosed in all publications and presentations, ensuring that readers and audiences are aware of any potential biases. They must also be reported on grant applications, disclosed to the university’s COI office as required by institutional policy, communicated to Steven and relevant lab members who are working on related projects, and included in IRB applications when relevant to human subjects research. The goal is to ensure that all stakeholders—from funding agencies to research participants—can evaluate your work with full knowledge of any potential competing interests.\n\n\n15.2.2 How to Disclose\nWhen disclosing conflicts of interest, be as specific as possible about the nature of the relationship rather than using vague language. Include dollar amounts when relevant, as the magnitude of a financial interest can affect how it should be managed. Remember to update your disclosures when circumstances change—conflicts are not static, and new relationships or changes to existing ones must be reported promptly. When in doubt, err on the side of over-disclosure rather than under-disclosure. It’s better to disclose something that turns out to be minor than to fail to disclose something that could later be seen as problematic."

Third, discuss the situation with Steven to work together to determine if management beyond disclosure is needed.

Could this relationship influence my research decisions, even subconsciously? Would I be comfortable if this relationship became public or was reported in the media? Am I avoiding disclosure because it feels uncomfortable or because I’m worried about how it might be perceived? If you answer “yes” or “maybe” to any of these questions, it’s likely worth disclosing.\nWhen in doubt, disclose. It’s always better to be transparent! And if you have any questions you can always come and talk to Steven or a Senior Lab Member."

    "text": "16.1 Initiating Collaborations\n\n16.1.1 Internal Collaborations\nSuccessful internal collaborations begin with clear communication. Before committing significant time to a new collaborative project, discuss your project ideas with Steven to ensure alignment with lab priorities and avoid duplication of effort. Be explicit about authorship expectations early in the process—having these conversations upfront prevents misunderstandings later. Document each collaborator’s roles and responsibilities clearly so everyone knows what’s expected of them, and use shared project management tools like Notion or GitHub projects to keep everyone on the same page throughout the project lifecycle.\n\n\n16.1.2 External Collaborations\nExternal collaborations can bring new perspectives and resources to our work, but they require additional planning and formal agreements. Steven should be informed of external collaboration discussions early, even in preliminary stages, so he can provide guidance and ensure the collaboration aligns with lab goals and policies. Once you decide to move forward, create a collaboration agreement that outlines project goals and timeline, clarifies each party’s contributions and responsibilities, establishes authorship expectations, specifies data ownership and sharing arrangements, outlines publication plans including timelines and review processes, and addresses any funding arrangements or cost-sharing agreements. Having these elements in writing protects everyone involved and provides a reference point if questions arise later."

    "text": "16.2 Data Sharing with Collaborators\n\n16.2.1 Before Sharing Data\nData sharing is essential for collaboration, but it must be done responsibly and legally. Before sharing any data with collaborators, ensure you have permission to share by checking your IRB protocols and consent forms to verify that data sharing is allowed. Execute data use agreements when necessary, particularly for sensitive data or when sharing with external collaborators. Share only the minimum data needed for the collaboration—there’s no need to share entire datasets when a subset will suffice. Whenever possible, de-identify data before sharing to protect participant privacy, even when working with trusted collaborators.\n\n\n16.2.2 Data Use Agreements\nFor sensitive data or external collaborations, formal data use agreements provide important protections. These agreements should establish permitted uses of the data so collaborators understand what analyses or applications are acceptable, specify restrictions on further sharing to prevent data from being distributed beyond the agreed-upon parties, outline requirements for data security including storage and transmission protocols, detail plans for data destruction or return once the collaboration is complete, and clarify publication and authorship expectations related to work using the shared data. These agreements may seem formal, but they protect both you and your collaborators and ensure everyone has the same understanding of how data can be used."

    "text": "16.3 Intellectual Property\n\n16.3.1 General Principles\nIntellectual property in academic research is primarily protected through authorship and open sharing rather than through patents or proprietary restrictions. Ideas developed using lab resources belong to the collaborative team—no single person can claim exclusive ownership of concepts developed with shared lab infrastructure and support. Individual contributions should be recognized through authorship on publications, presentations, and other scholarly outputs. Novel methods, tools, or software should be shared openly when possible, contributing to the broader scientific community and allowing others to build on our work."

    "text": "16.4 Multi-Lab Projects\nLarge collaborative projects involving multiple labs require additional structure and coordination. For these projects, establish a clear governance structure and decision-making processes at the outset so everyone knows who has authority over different aspects of the project. Create detailed project timelines with milestones to keep the work on track and allow for progress monitoring. Hold regular check-in meetings—monthly or quarterly depending on the project timeline—to ensure all teams are aligned and to address any emerging issues. Document all major decisions in shared meeting notes or project management systems so there’s a record of how and why choices were made. Perhaps most importantly, agree on authorship criteria before work begins, including how author order will be determined and what contributions merit authorship versus acknowledgment."

    "text": "16.5 When Collaborations Go Wrong\nDespite best intentions and careful planning, conflicts can arise in collaborative work. When they do, address issues early before they escalate—small misunderstandings are much easier to resolve than major conflicts. Document concerns in writing, whether through email or shared documents, to create a record and ensure everyone has the same understanding of the issues. If you can’t resolve a conflict directly with your collaborator, involve Steven in mediation—he can provide an outside perspective and help find solutions that work for everyone. For serious disputes, follow institutional procedures for resolving conflicts, which may involve department chairs, ombudspersons, or other university resources. Whatever the outcome, try to learn from the experience to prevent future issues—reflect on what went wrong and what could be done differently next time."

If you see any funding opportunities pop up, feel free to share with the lab via Slack or email.\nThe lab is usually able to cover the cost of lab-wide or full project team events, such as lunches, dinners, and retreats. The lab will usually not cover expenses for individual or small-group activities. If you have any questions about the lab covering the cost of an activity, please check with the admin team, Steven, and/or the Finance Office."

    "text": "16.6 Best Practices\nSuccessful collaborations share several common practices. Communicate frequently—over-communication is better than under-communication, and regular check-ins prevent surprises. Be responsive by replying to collaborator emails within 48 hours, even if just to acknowledge receipt and indicate when you’ll provide a full respons at a later time. Meet deadlines, or if you can’t, communicate early about the delay so your collaborators can adjust their plans accordingly. Give credit generously by acknowledging contributions explicitly in conversations, presentations, and publications—recognition costs nothing and builds goodwill. Be open to feedback, remembering that collaboration involves compromise and that others’ perspectives can strengthen your work. Finally, document everything—shared documents, meeting notes, and email trails protect everyone by creating a record of decisions, agreements, and contributions throughout the collaboration."
