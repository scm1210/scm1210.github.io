    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nWell-being is often defined in terms of a person’s comfort, happiness, functioning and flourishing. Scholars distinguish subjective well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as pleasant) from psychological well-being (i.e., perceiving one’s life as meaningful). Advances in natural language processing have yielded automated assessments of psychological states and traits from language alone, including subjective well-being. However, the strength of these tools for assessing psychological well-being remains unstudied. Across three studies (one preregistered), we examined the strength of language-based assessments of self-reported subjective and psychological well-being components. Participants gave verbal or written responses to queries regarding their satisfaction with life and autonomy, along with questionnaire measures of subjective and psychological well-being. We then tested the strength of contextual word embeddings generated from AI-based transformers applied to verbal responses in predicting self-reported satisfaction with life and psychological well-being. Predictions generated from word embeddings of open-ended assessments correlated significantly with questionnaire measures of corresponding well-being constructs (rs = .16 &lt; r &lt; .63) and they also generalized across well-being components (rs = .15 &lt; r &lt; .50). However, the strength of these relations was lower than previous studies (rs = .72 &lt; r &lt; .85), and sense of autonomy was consistently less predictable than satisfaction with life. These findings demonstrate that although linguistic measures can significantly correlate with one’s sense of autonomy, it appears to be more challenging to assess than other forms of well-being.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., Cosme, D., Nook, E.

    "text": "Abstract\nDecades of research hold that empathy is a multifaceted construct. A related challenge in empathy research is to describe how each subcomponent of empathy uniquely contributes to social outcomes. Here, we examined distinct mechanisms through which different components of empathy—Empathic Concern, Perspective Taking, and Personal Distress—may relate to prosociality. Participants (N = 77) watched a prerecorded video of a person sharing an emotional real-life story and provided verbal support in response. The listeners then reported how positive and negative they felt while listening to the story. We found that individuals with greater tendencies to experience Empathic Concern and Perspective Taking felt more positive (e.g., connected, compassionate), whereas those with higher Personal Distress felt more negative (e.g., nervous, anxious) in response to another’s suffering. We also observed indirect relationships between Empathic Concern / Perspective Taking and the tendency to help others through positive affective responses to the other’s suffering. These findings build upon the growing literature that distinguishes different components of empathy and their mechanisms that relate to divergent behavioral consequences. Results also highlight the role of positive affect that may motivate prosociality in the face of others’ suffering.\nCitation: Kang, Y., Mesquiti, S., Baik, E. S., & Falk, E. B. (2025).

    "text": "This piece was published as an Op-ed in the San Antonio Express News\nScientific progress in the United States faces a series of threats. These disruptions have slashed federal research funding; upended the scientific process; dismantled diversity, equity and inclusion — DEI — initiatives; and endangered the careers of future and current scientists.\nIn particular, the federal government has frozen billions in funding for the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation — both of which provide substantial medical and economic benefits to San Antonio and Texas.\nLast year, the NIH awarded nearly $2 billion in funding to Texan institutes, which supported more than 30,000 Texan jobs and generated more than $6 billion in economic activity.\nAs a scientist, I am deeply concerned about these funding cuts. I strongly believe in the direct and indirect opportunities that science provides to improve the lives of our community members.\nI am a Mexican American who was born and raised on San Antonio’s West Side, where programs like the Pre-Freshman Engineering Program, or PREP, gave me early exposure to careers in science and laid the foundation for my academic journey.\nToday, I am fortunate enough to be a psychology doctoral student at Princeton University, where I am conducting research showing how to identify individuals struggling with poor mental health by examining patterns in their language use.\nPrograms like PREP provided my first introduction to research, which was further developed in labs at Texas State University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Pennsylvania — all institutions supported by grants from the NIH and NSF.\nPrograms like PREP, often labeled as “DEI initiatives,” are not about exclusion. They are about giving everyone a shot at the American Dream. They ensure young people without built-in academic connections or financial resources have opportunities to pursue careers in science.\nWithout these programs, countless students — regardless of race, gender or political affiliation — will lose their chance to break into fields that shape our nation’s future.\nStripping funding from anything perceived as “DEI-adjacent” harms us all. It reduces available jobs in the state, freezes life-changing research and shuts the door on talented, hardworking students.\nTo make matters worse, recent government budget cuts have slashed funding for universities, including critical “indirect costs” that fund lab space, technical support, and salaries for scientists and staff.\nUniversities across the country, including the University of Texas at San Antonio, have already begun reducing graduate admissions. This disruption will shrink the pipeline of trained scientists, limit opportunities for young San Antonians, and jeopardize scientific progress in Texas and beyond.\nDue to decades of federally funded research, we have breakthroughs like revolutionary cancer treatments and lifesaving vaccines. Similar advancements have been made in our ability to detect mental health issues with language and provide more personalized support — progress that can save countless lives.\nThese advancements depend on continued support from institutions like the NIH and NSF, which drive our economy, research and the training of future scientists.\nPrograms that provide early exposure to science — especially for underrepresented students — ensure that the next generation is prepared to tackle issues like the mental health epidemic.\nCutting funding for research and training will stall progress and limit opportunities for young minds. Now more than ever, we must fight to protect science and its future to build a healthier, more resilient society for everyone.\n\nAbout the Author\nSteven Mesquiti was born and raised in San Antonio’s West Side. He completed his undergraduate studies at Southwestern University, has a master’s degree from Texas State University and is a doctoral student at Princeton University."

    "text": "This guide walks you through configuring your environment, authenticating access, and downloading the LLaMA 3 models from Hugging Face on the Adroit HPC system. It assumes you have basic familiarity with command line, Python, and HPC usage.\nThis process is infinitely easier if you have connected VSCode to the adroit cluster. Here is some info on that. IT also runs help sessions on this, which are very useful.\n\n\nBy default, Hugging Face stores downloaded models in your home directory (e.g., /home/username/.cache/huggingface), which may have limited storage on HPC systems. Redirect the cache to your scratch directory for ample space.\nYou can do that by using the checkquota command in the terminal to find out how much space you have in your scratch directory.\n\nSet the environment variable HF_HOME to your scratch directory:\n\nOn the Adroit login node, run this command to append the export statement to your .bashrc:\necho \"export HF_HOME=/scratch/network/$USER/.cache/huggingface/\" &gt;&gt; $HOME/.bashrc\n\nReload your shell configuration:\n\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\nVerify the variable is set:\n\necho $HF_HOME\nThe excpected output should be:\n/scratch/network/&lt;YourNetID&gt;/.cache/huggingface/\n\n\n\nMeta requires users to accept a license and gain explicit access to the LLaMA 3 models on Hugging Face. So, this means you’ll need sign up for a Hugging Face account and request access to the LLaMA 3 models.\n\nGo to the LLaMA 3 model page on Hugging Face: https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B (or whatever model you want access to)\nLog in or create a Hugging Face account if you haven’t already.\nAccept the model license terms: Click the “Access repository” button and agree to the license to request access.\nWait for access to be granted. This should be relatively quick, but may take a few minutes to a few hours depending on demand.\n\n\n\n\nOnce access is granted, authenticate your HPC environment to allow downloading protected models.\n\nLog in to Hugging Face CLI:\n\nOn the Adroit login node, run the following command:\nhuggingface-cli login\n\nEnter your Hugging Face token:\n\nYou will be prompted to enter your Hugging Face access token. You can find this token in your Hugging Face account settings under “Access Tokens”. Copy and paste it into the terminal when prompted. Make sure not to share this with anyone since this is a personal access token that allows downloading models.\n\n\n\nNow that you have authenticated, you can download the LLaMA 3 model to your scratch directory.\n\nCreate a Python script download_llama3.py with this content:\n\nMake sure to replace meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B with the specific model you want\nto download if different. Also, make sure you have transformers installed in your Python environment.\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM\n\nmodel_id = \"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B\"\ncache_path = \"/scratch/network/sm9518/.cache/huggingface\"  # replace with your actual NetID\n\n# Download model and tokenizer to cache\nAutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=cache_path)\nAutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_id, cache_dir=cache_path)\n\nprint(f\"{model_id} Downloaded Successfully! to {cache_path}\")\n\nRun the script on the login node:\n\npython download_llama3.py\n\nThis will download all necessary model files into your scratch cache directory set by HF_HOME.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you have downloaded the LLaMA 3 model to your scratch directory, you can run inference on an HPC compute node.\n\n\nSave the following code to /scratch/network/$USER/python_test/run_test_llama.py. This script loads the model and runs a short text generation example using the transformers pipeline API.\nfrom transformers import pipeline\nimport torch\nimport os\n\nprint(f\"CUDA Available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}\")\n\nif not torch.cuda.is_available():\n    raise ValueError(\n        \"CUDA is not available.

    "text": "Abstract\nUsing social media data, the present study documents how three successive upheavals: the COVID pandemic, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests of 2020, and the US Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade interacted to impact the cognitive, emotional, and social styles of people in the US. Text analyses were conducted on 45,225,895 Reddit comments from 2,451,289 users and 889,402 news headlines from four news sources. Results revealed significant shifts in language related to self-focus (e.g., first-person singular pronouns), collective-focus (e.g., first-person plural pronouns), negative emotion (anxiety and anger words), and engagement (e.g., discussion of upheaval-related topics) after each event. Language analyses captured how social justice-related upheavals (BLM, Roe v. Wade) may have affected people in different ways emotionally than those that affected them personally (COVID). The onset of COVID was related to people becoming increasingly anxious and people turned inward to focus on their personal situations. However, BLM and the overturning of Roe v. Wade aroused anger and action, as people may have looked beyond themselves to address these issues. Analysis of upheaval-related discussions captured the public’s sustained interest in BLM and COVID, whereas interest in Roe v. Wade declined relatively quickly. Shifts in discussions also showed how events interacted as people focused on only one national event at a time, with interest in other events dampening when a new event occurred. The findings underscore the dynamic nature of culturally shared events that are apparent in everyday online language use.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., Seraj, S., Weyland, A. H., Ashokkumar, A., Boyd, R.

    "text": "Abstract\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on business leadership, specifically on chief executive officers (CEOs). To document the psychological impacts of the pandemic on corporate leadership, this study analyzed the language of CEOs during company quarterly earnings calls (N=19,536) one year before and after the onset of the pandemic. Following the start of lockdowns, CEOs exhibited significant language shifts. Analytic thinking declined, and their language became less technical and more personal and intuitive. CEOs also showed signs of increased cognitive load as they grappled with the pandemic’s impact on their business practices. The study observed a substantial decrease in collective-focused language (we-usage) among CEOs, indicative of disconnection from their companies. Concurrently, there was an increase in self-focused (I-usage) language, suggesting heightened preoccupation among business leaders. The observed language changes reflect the unique effect of the pandemic on CEOs, which had some notable differences compared to the general population. This study sheds light on how the COVID-19 pandemic influenced business leaders’ psychological states and decision-making strategies—processes that have a substantial impact on a company’s performance. The findings underscore the importance of language data in understanding large-scale societal events.\nCitation: Mesquiti, S., & Seraj, S. (2023).
