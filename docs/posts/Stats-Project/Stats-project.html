<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This tutorial will walk you through the process of simulating Pokémon battles using the <code>OpenAI</code> API and then analyzing the results using a multi-level binary logistic regression model using a Specification Curve Analysis framework. The main analytic goal is to see which Pokemon stats are most predictive of winning a battle.</p>
<p>We are using a <em>multi-level</em> binary logistic regression model given the multiple levels of data we have. Each battle is a unique observation, but each Pokémon has multiple stats that are used to predict the outcome of the battle. This means that we need to account for the fact that different Pokémon may have different effects on the outcome of the battle. Further, we have to employ a logistic regression framework since our outcome is binary (win/loss).</p>

<p>First, before we conduct any statistical analyses, we will use the OpenAI API to simulate Pokémon battles. This will allow us to create a dataset of battle outcomes based on Pokémon stats. We are going to use <code>gpt-3.5-turbo</code> to simulate the battles. Given that this is a rather simple task, we don’t need to leverage a terribly complex or powerful model (e.g., <code>gpt-4</code>).</p>
<section id="load-libraries-api-key-and-set-model-information" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="load-libraries-api-key-and-set-model-information">Load Libraries, API Key, and set model information</h2>
<p>Start by loading in the necessary libraries (and installing them if necessary) and setting up the OpenAI API key. I’d recommend running this in a separate notebook, as it will take a while to run the ~3000 individual battles. We also set a temperature of 0 to make the model <em>more</em> deterministic.</p>

<p>💡 It is important to note that you should not share your OpenAI API key with anyone. It is a sensitive piece of information that should be kept private. If you are using a public notebook or sharing your code, make sure to remove or mask your API key before sharing. You can use environment variables or a <code>.env</code> file to store your API key securely.</p>

<p>Before we run the simulations, we have to create our dataset. This can be done by downloading the original kaggle dataset <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rzgiza/pokdex-for-all-1025-pokemon-w-text-description">here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you’ve done so, we will extract the original 151 Pokémon and create a dataset of 20 matchups for each Pokémon.</p>

<p>Once we’ve created the dataset, we can use the <code>OpenAI</code> API to simulate the match-ups. In short, for each battle, we will feed the stats of both Pokémon and ask GPT to determine the winner. We can then extract and save that data for downstream analyses.</p>

<p>💡 The API call is rate limited, so we need to be careful about how many requests we send. We will use the <code>tqdm</code> library to show a progress bar and add a sleep time between requests to avoid hitting the rate limit.</p>
<p>Our prompt is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>    "Based on the stats, which Pokémon would win a one-on-one battle?\n\n"
    f"{p1_stats}\nVS\n\n{p2_stats}\n\n"

<p>Now, we can start to explore the data. We will start by looking at the distribution of the various Pokémon stats. We will also look at the relationship between the stats and the outcome of the battle (win/loss). This will help us understand how the different stats relate to each other and to winning or losing a battle.</p>

<p>From looking at the density plots we have some interesting insights. For example, we can see that the distribution of the Pokémon stats is not normal, and that there are some outliers in the data. We’ll leave them in since we are interested in the relationship between the stats and the outcome of the battle and know this is how the Pokemon appear in the game.</p>

<p>This plot shows how different Pokémon stats relate to each other and to winning or losing a battle. The diagonal panels show how each stat is distributed for winners (green) and losers (red). The lower panels show relationships between pairs of stats, with trendlines and points colored by outcome. The upper panels give the strength of the relationship between each pair of stats. Look for where the green and red separate—those are the stats or stat combinations most associated with winning or losing.</p>

<h1 class="tabset">Predict Outcomes with Multilevel Binary Logistic Regression using <code>Specr</code></h1>
<p>Now that we have a sense of the various relationships, we can fit binary logistic regression models to predict our outcome (win/loss).</p>
<p>We will fit our models using a <strong>specification curve analysis (SCA)</strong> framework, via the <code>Specr</code> package in R. You can learn more about <code>Specr</code> <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/specr/vignettes/specr.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>SCA will allow us to see how the model changes as we add or remove variables in a transparent manner. Briefly, SCA is a method for exploring the robustness of statistical results across different model specifications. It involves systematically varying the model’s parameters, such as the choice of predictors or the functional form, and examining how these changes affect the estimated coefficients and their significance.</p>
<p>The main goal is to assess whether the main findings hold up under different assumptions and to identify which specifications yield consistent results.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="view-the-plots">View the Plots</h2>
<p>We can view our results using the <code>plot</code> function from <code>specr</code>. This simplest way to visualize most of the information contained in the results dataframe produced by our analyses. Briefly, the first plot shows the odds ratios for each model, while the second plot shows the specifications used in each model. The odds ratios are plotted on a log scale, and the confidence intervals are shown as error bars. The second plot shows the specifications used in each model, with the x-axis showing the different specifications and the y-axis showing the number of models that used that specification.</p>
<p>Given that we have several hundred unique models this graph gets kinda crazy to look at. You can zoom in on the plot to see the details. We’ll walk through two other ways to extract information from our results below.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individually-inspect-the-top-n-models">Individually Inspect the top N-Models</h2>
<p>Now that we used <code>specr()</code>, we can summarize individual specifications by using <code>broom::tidy()</code> and <code>broom::glance()</code>. For most cases, this provides a sufficient and appropriate summary of the relationship of interest and model characteristics. Sometimes, however, it might be useful to investigate specific models in more detail or to investigate a specific parameter that is not provided by the two functions (e.g., <em>r-square</em> or variance accounted for by the model).</p>
<section id="inspect-the-significant-models" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="inspect-the-significant-models">Inspect the significant models</h3>
<p>First, we’ll look at just the significant models (i.e., <em>p</em> &lt; 0.05). This is done by filtering the results dataframe to only include significant models. We can then use the <code>DT</code> package to create an interactive table that allows us to sort and filter the data.</p>

<p>We can also evaluate the best model by looking at the conditional r-square value. We start by ranking the models by their conditional r-square value and then plotting the results. This will allow us to see which models are the best predictors of the outcome.</p>
<p>From the results below, we can see that we can account for over 50% of the variance in the outcome using just the challenger Pokemon’s stats. This is a pretty good result, and it suggests that we can use these stats to predict the outcome of a battle. However, we still don’t quite know what the <em>recipe</em> for the best model is yet.</p>

<p>Based on what our graph tells us, the best model is <code>(1 | challenger) + s_defense</code>. This model accounts for 55% of the variance in the outcome, which is a pretty good result. However, it’s important to note that this is a pretty simple model and there are likely other factors that could be included to improve the model. For example, we could include the opponent’s stats or other variables that might be relevant to the outcome of the battle. If anything, this goes to show how balanced of a meta Pokemon has.</p>
